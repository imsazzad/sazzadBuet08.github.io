A very adaptive person Sazzad has the courage to pick up work on areas that he hasn’t worked in before and his enthusiasm is very impressive. I had an enjoyable experience with Sazzad and wish to see him contributing to the community as a great software developer going forward.",

Back in 2011 we were both part of a Software Engineering study group, and even though he was still a student and had tons of coursework he still managed to attend all the regular study sessions. This also shows that he is a hard worker. He has very good knowledge of OOP and basic Software Engineering as well. As a person he is very humble, modest, and helpful. I wish him all the best in his career!",

    "deep_care":"The DeepCare solution allows Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) and nurses to monitor more closely the ambulatory status of residents at eldercare and assisted living facilities. DeepCare uses Deep Learning and other machine learning techniques to determine whether a resident is sitting, walking, standing or climbing stairs. Wearables or smartphones outfitted with the app continuously sends sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS) data to a back-end server. The system then uses the machine-learning models to accurately predict the class of activity the user is performing.\n" +
